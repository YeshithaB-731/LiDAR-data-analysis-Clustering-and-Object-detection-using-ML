# LiDAR-data-analysis-Clustering-and-Object-detection-using-ML
LiDAR-based 3D object detection for autonomous driving is quickly gaining a lot of interest as the LiDAR sensor is much more reliable as compared to other sensors and helps incorporate features like capacity to capture 3d objects (length, height, width), visibility in the night, and considering the large amount of data it is able to capture, it has the capability to predict distance between the vehicles, pedestrians, etc, very accurately.   One of the biggest challenges for LiDAR data is the sheer amount of point clouds that each scan produces and how to efficiently and quickly process the data to get the best object detection results.  Our goal is to achieve clustering of the point cloud datas (PCDâ€™s), Feature extraction from LiDAR data, and also to list the clustered objects that are detected.  The purpose of this work is to use naive architecture so as to understand the concepts of machine learning and to gain hands-on experience with Python. It is also to make use of LiDAR sensing features in fast detection of objects hence proving it to be a safer technique that could be used in autonomous vehicles.
